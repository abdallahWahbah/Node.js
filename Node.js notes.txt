// section 2: intro to nodejs and npm
**********************************************************

// we use nodejs to run code outside the browser (server) using v8 engine made by google

///// create a new application
# npm init >>>> press enter multiple time for default installation
# npm install nodemon --global >>>> (only one time on your pc) automatically restart the server every time we do a change
# nodemon index.js
or (instead of the last line)
open package.json, script
"start": "nodemon index.js"
# npm run start  >>> or npm start

slugify >>> to replace spaces with "-" // ex: Fresh Avocados >>> fresh-avocados

// section 4: How Node.js works: a look behind the scenes
**********************************************************

// Node.js is a js run time based on v8
// v8 converts js to machine code that the computer can understand 
// libuv: open source library with a strong focus on async IO (input/output), gives node access to operating system, File system, networking and more
// libuv implements event loop and thread pool
// event loop is responsible for handling easy tasks like callbacks and network IO
// threed pool is for heavy work like file access or compression
// if you run node.js application, it will run on a single thread no matter if we have 10 users or a million accessing the application at the same time which block execution
// event loop makes async operation possible in node.js moving the heavy tasks to the thread pool
